    <p> Hi Hi, my name is Dolynn.<br>
Nice to meet you <br>

I’m a year 2 student currently studying in Singapore Polytechnic under the diploma of Visual Effect and Motion Graphics. <br></br>


<br>Why did I pick this elective module?

<br>I picked this elective as I wanted to try something different and learn more prototyping as I wasn’t given a chance to 3D print things before, I find it interesting to see ideas come to life and become an actual product. That’s why I took this elective to find out more about prototyping.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">Safety, FABLAB</h2> <br></br> 
    <p class="w3-justify"> We have to read through the safety issues in the lab and watch a video where we learn what and what not to do in the lab.
After going through the videos and slides we when on our school page and took a test on safety. <br></br>

From that I learn that <br>
-We have to wear long pants when using the lab<br>
- Girls with long hair has to tie their hair up<br>
-We are to wear covered shoes at all times<br>
-We are not to wear accessories when using the equipment in the lab<br>
-We are not allowed to eat or drink in the lab <br>
-Only work in the lab when supervise by either a lecturer or the technical support officer<br>
-Do not use any machinery unless instructed by<br>
-Report any unsafe issues</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">Prototyping</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify"> Prototyping with cardboards.<br>
As our first assignment we were asked to do a cardboard model of one of the following items:<br>
<center>
•  Portable handphone holder that you can put in your backpack<br>
•  Earbuds keeper to stop the wires from tangling<br>
•  Headphone keeper, to keep your headphones at the side of your table 
<br></br></center></p>

<p class="w3-justify">
As such I choose to make a portable handphone holder out of cardboard. <br>
Firstly, I had to sketch out my idea. I had many ideas in the beginning so I sketch everything out and choose a final design. <br> 
Which lead to an idea of having the handphone stand behind able to fold and turn into a normal handphone stand when using, when not it use it’s like a flat object which can be open and place in the bag to save space. <br>
Secondly, I had to draw out the dimensions of the box and cut it out accordingly. <br>
Finally, I pasted everything together. <br>
For the bending part I had to use tape to tape it together to create a bending effect .
In the end, the product worked well. <br></br>
What I learn from prototyping : <br>
-It was a fun hands on experience as I was able to turn my idea into a prototype and test it out.<br>
- Dimensions are important and I have to draw it as accurately as possible.<br> </p></left>

We were asked to watch a video by Jake Wright on HTML and CSS in under 12 minutes to learn the basic of making a webpage.
From what I learn in the video CSS is a stylesheet for HTML it is commonly used to page a website page look more aesthetically pleasing and organised.<br></br>
My first test website.<br>
As I was using a MacBook, I didn’t have CSS and had to use my friend's computer to type out the CSS and HTML file in their TextEditor . 
I rearranged and change the colour of the original html and CSS that the Jake wright video taught .</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"> The class was asked to learn about Fusion 360 by going through the videos online. <br>
Through the videos, I've learnt how to draw the basic shapes, extrude and add dimensions in my work. By attempting given assignments, I became familiar with the essentials of Fusion 360. <br>



<center><u>3D Model</u> <br></center>

After getting to know more about Fusion 360 we were tasked to draw out a name tag and a fidget spinner. <br> </p>

<p class="w3-justify">
Name tag: <br>
-  The first thing I did was to sketch out the hole where the keyring was going through at the origin as to gauge where the rest of my name tag is going to be.<br>
-  I then added the base in and my letters in <br>
-  Lastly all I have left is to extrude my keychain <br></br>

Fidget Spinner: <br>
-  I tried to draw a shuriken fidget spinner by drawing the first triangle at the origin <br>
-  I mirrored the triangle to all 3 sides and got myself a base of my fidget spinner <br>
-  Using the circle tool, I drew a circle in the center of the shuriken shape for the ball bearing to be <br> 
-  Lastly, I drew 4 circles where the nut is going to be <br>

    <p class="w3-justify"> Chess Piece <br>
 
We were asked to draw a knight piece to 3d print. <br>
-  Firstly, I had to draw a rectangle with the dimension of 35mm by 50 mm <br>
-  Next, I had to import an image into Fusion but adding a canvas and adjusting the size of the image to match the rectangle <br>
-  Next, I trace the outline of the horse by using the spine and line tool <br>
-  Then, I extrude the face of the horse first before preparing to draw the base.<br></br>
The base was more complicated to do as I have to revolve it <br>
-  Firstly, I had to sketch out the half the shape of the base <br>
-  Next, I had to use the revolve tool, and revolve the base it will show up as a full base.<br>
-  Lastly, I had to join the 2 body together into 1.<br>
That’s how I did my knight piece.<br></br>
The Knight piece is an interesting model to do as I get to use different tools such as revolve and spline.
The revolve was hard to control at first as I couldn’t tell which axis I had to use to revolve it correctly. <br>
Overall it was an interesting exercise to do.<br></br>


Laser Cutting<br>

The class was asked to draw a box using parameter tool in Fusion. <br>
We had to draw a box with finger for tight fitting, so we don’t have to use glue to stick it together.<br>
