   We were asked to draw a knight piece to 3d print. <br>
-  Firstly, I had to draw a rectangle with the dimension of 35mm by 50 mm <br>
-  Next, I had to import an image into Fusion but adding a canvas and adjusting the size of the image to match the rectangle <br>
-  Next, I trace the outline of the horse by using the spine and line tool <br>
-  Then, I extrude the face of the horse first before preparing to draw the base.<br></br>
The base was more complicated to do as I have to revolve it <br>
-  Firstly, I had to sketch out the half the shape of the base <br>
-  Next, I had to use the revolve tool, and revolve the base it will show up as a full base.<br>
-  Lastly, I had to join the 2 body together into 1.<br>
That’s how I did my knight piece.<br></br>
The Knight piece is an interesting model to do as I get to use different tools such as revolve and spline.
The revolve was hard to control at first as I couldn’t tell which axis I had to use to revolve it correctly. <br>
Overall it was an interesting exercise to do.<br></br>


Laser Cutting<br>

The class was asked to draw a box using parameter tool in Fusion. <br>
We had to draw a box with finger for tight fitting, so we don’t have to use glue to stick it together.<br>
