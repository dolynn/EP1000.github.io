<p> Hi Hi, my name is Dolynn.<br>
Nice to meet you <br>

I’m a year 2 student currently studying in Singapore Polytechnic under the diploma of Visual Effect and Motion Graphics. <br></br>


<br>Why did I pick this elective module?

<br>I picked this elective as I wanted to try something different and learn more prototyping as I wasn’t given a chance to 3D print things before, I find it interesting to see ideas come to life and become an actual product. That’s why I took this elective to find out more about prototyping.</p>
